This project manifests the use of props of React.

## props
--> Simply for the properties
--> Quite useful to make the components in React dynamic.
--> Passed similar to 'arguments' in JS function.
--> Received props is object

## map() 
--> Returns a new array. 
--> Whatever gets returned from the callback
function provided is placed at the same index in the new array.
--> Usually we take the items from the original array and modify them in some way.
--> saves time and makes code shorter & faster.

## spread syntax
--> new ES6 feature
--> allows an iterable(array or string) to be expanded in places where zero or more arguments (for function calls) or elements (for array literals) are expected.
